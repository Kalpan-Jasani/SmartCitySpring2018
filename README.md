# Smart City project
This project is for data analysis team for the smart city project at Purdue EPICS
## What do we do?
This project is part of the Smartcity project. The goal is to automate the detection and quantification of potholes, using economically viable Kinect sensors
As the Data Analysis team, we take depth data, analyze it using mathematical tools such as Plane Fitting, Otsu's binarization, and Rectangle Bounding. We use a standard called the ASTM standard, to determine the severity of the pothole

## To run the program

You would firsly need the scientific libraries of matplotlib, numpy and open cv. These are easy to install with Anaconda software, a solution for having a collection of such libraries!

Then, clone the repository to your own pc or laptop.
Once you have that set up, it is easy to run the program. The data is avaialable in the input_files. Copy paste any file as "data.txt" in the root folder, and run the program dataAnalysis17.py. The 17 is because it started in Fall 2017.
